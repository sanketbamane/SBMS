Yesterday's session : JpaRepository methods
--------------------------------------------

-> For every table we have to maintain primary key column

-> Primary Key constraint is used to achieve uniqueness for column data

-> Primary Key constraint is the combination of below 2 constraints  

	1) NOT NULL
	2) UNIQUE


-> If we ask end user to enter the value for Primary Key column he/she may enter duplicate value.

-> If we try to insert a record with duplicate value then Save Contact functionality will fail.


-> To avoid this problem ORM frameworks provided Generators concept.

What are Generators?
--------------------
-> Generators are used to generate the value for Primary Key Column

-> When we use Generators in application, before saving the record primary key value will be generated with in application then record will be inserted into table along with primary key.


-> Hibernate framework provided several built-in generators. Every Generator will have its own alogorithm to generate value for Primary Key column.






------------Entity class with Generator-----------------------
@Data
@Entity
@Table(name = "STUDENTS_TBL")
public class Student {

	@Id
	@Column(name = "STUDENT_ID")
	@GeneratedValue
	private Integer studentId;

	@Column(name = "STUDENT_NAME")
	private String studentName;

	@Column(name = "STUDENT_GENDER")
	private String studentGender;

}
------------------------------------------------------------------
-> When we use @GeneratedValue annotation, it will use hibernate_sequence to get primary key value.

-> hibernate_sequence is the default sequence which comes with hibernate. It will start from 1 and it will increment by 1.

-> When we execute save operation, application will read next value from the sequence.    

	select hibernate_sequence.nextval from dual
