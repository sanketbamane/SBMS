Yesterday's session : Custom Sequence in Data JPA
-------------------------------------------------

-> Sequence is used to generate values

-> We will use sequence to generate value for primary key column

-> For every primary key column we will create one sequence

-> In Hibernate we have support for Custom Sequence

-> To configure Custom Sequence we will use @SequenceGenerator annotation


@SequenceGenerator(sequenceName="", name="", allocationSize="")
@GeneratedValue(generator="", startegy="")
private Integer orderId;
-------------------------------------------------------------------

CREATE SEQUENCE ORDER_ID_SEQ
START WITH 1
INCREMENT BY 1;

SELECT ORDER_ID_SEQ.NEXTVAL FROM DUAL;


Note: Sequences are DB dependent

Oracle db supports sequences where as mysql db will not support for sequences.


-> To support mysql db primary keys, hibernate provided IDENTITY generator.



Generation Strategy = AUTO
==========================
@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)

This strategy will work based on DB which is using in the application

If we are using Oracle, it will use hibernate_sequence

If we are using MySql, it will use identity generator


Generation Strategy = IDENTITY
==============================
@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)


When we use this IDENTITY startegy it will expect DB to generate value for PK column.

For MYSQL db we will use this strategy with AutoIncrement concept.

Note: For Oracle DB we can't use this IDENTITY generator.
