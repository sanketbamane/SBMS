Spring MVC
----------
-> Spring MVC is one of the module available in Spring Framework

-> Using Spring MVC module we can develop below types of applications

		1)Web applications (C 2 B)

		2)Distributed Applications (B 2 B)


What is Web Application?
-----------------------
Any application that we can access from browser is called as web application.

Web Applications will have user interface

End user will directley communicate with web application

	Ex: facebook, irctc, gmail etc...



What is Distributed Application?
--------------------------------
-> If one application is communicating with another application then they are called as distributed applications.

-> We will use Webservices or Restfulservices to represent application as Distributed Application.

-> End users will not communicate with Webservices Or Restful services directley.

-> Distributed applications provides Business To Business Communication channel (B 2 B)

Ex:  weather-forecasting, stock-prices, flight-details etc....

-----------------------------------------------------------------

-> Spring MVC module is developed using 2 Design Patterns

		1) MVC
		2) Front Controller


MVC
----
-> MVC means Model View Controller

-> Model Represents Data

-> View Represents User Interface

-> Controller Represents Request Handling

-> Using this MVC architecture we can develop application components with loosely coupling.

-> If we achieve loosely coupling then Maintenence of the project will be easy.

Front Controller
-----------------
-> In web application we will develop Several Controllers to handle User Requests.

-> Front Controller acts as Entry Point for all requests.
