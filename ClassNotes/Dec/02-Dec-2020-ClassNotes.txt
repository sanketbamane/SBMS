Yesterday's session : Microservices Introduction
------------------------------------------------

Microservices is an Architectural Design Pattern which is used to develop applications

Microservices architecture came into market to resolve the problems of Monolith Architecture.

Challenges With Microservices
------------------------------
1) Bounded Context

2) Lot of configuration

3) Visibility

4) Pack of cards problem



-> Deciding boundary for Microservice is difficult

-> As we are developing multiple services in project, we have to configuration in every service. We will end up by writing lot of configurtion.

-> All the team members will not have clarity on all services because services will be developed by multiple teams.

-> If any crucial microservice got failed then remaining services also will fail to process that request.

Advantages of microservices
---------------------------
1) Easy Maintenence

2) Faster Releases

3) Parallel Development

4) We can use several technologies in project
