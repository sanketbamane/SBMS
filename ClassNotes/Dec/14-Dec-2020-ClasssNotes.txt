Yesterday's session : Actuators in SpringBoot
----------------------------------------------
-> To configure production ready features for our application we should add spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency in pom.xml file

-> By default health, info endpoints are enabled and exposed.

-> To expose remaining actuator endpoints we should add configuration in application.yml file

management:	
   endpoint:
	web:
	  exposure:
		include: "*"
		exclude: beans,env

-> We can check all the exposed endpoints using below url

		http://localhost:port-num/actuator

-> We can access particular actuator endpoint using /actuator as prefix

	/actuator/health   
	/actuator/info
	/actuator/beans 


Details of actuator endpoints
-----------------------------
health : It provides application health (UP or DOWN)

info : It provides application information

Note : info endpoint details we should add in application.yml file

beans : It provides all bean classes loaded by our application

mappings: It provides all url-patterns available in our application.

heapdump : Using this we can download heap details of jvm. It will download heap dump file. To analyze heap dump we will use MAT (Memory Analyzer Tool)

threadump : Using this we can get threads details which are running in our application

env : It provides env details of our application

**shutdown** : Using this we can stop the application

Note:: By default shutdown endpoint will be in disable mode. All the actuator endpoints are binded to HTTP GET Request where as 'SHUTDOWN' endponint is binded to HTTP POST Request.
