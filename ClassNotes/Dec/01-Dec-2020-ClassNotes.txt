Yesterday's session : Monolith Architecture & LBR

-----------------------------------------------------

-> In realtime application will be deployed into multiple servers to distribute the load.

-> When application is deployed in multiple servers we will configure all those servers to Load Balancer.

-> Load Balancer is responsible to distribute the load to servers which are connected.

Load Balancer Techniques
-------------------------
1) Round Robbin algorithm

2) Sticky Session

3) IP hashing

-> LBR infrastructure is costly.

-> When we have Monolith application, to reduce burden on server we will use LBR. It is costly solution.


-> To overcome the drawbacks of Monlith Architecture, Microservices Architecture came into market.
-------------------------------------------------------------

-> Microservies is not a technology

-> Microservices is not an API

-> Microservices is not a framework.

-> Microservices is an Architectural design pattern which is used to simplifi application development and maintenence.

-> Microservices Architecture talks about 'Divide & Conquer'

Limitations of Microservices
-----------------------------
1) Bounded Context
2) Lot of configuration
3) Visibility
4) Pack of cards


-> Defining boundary for Microservice is difficult
