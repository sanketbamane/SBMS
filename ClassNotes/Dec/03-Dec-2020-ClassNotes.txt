Yesterday's session : Challenges & Advantages of Microservices

Today's session : Microservices Architecture
--------------------------------------------------------------

Building Blocks Of Microservices Architecture
---------------------------------------------
1) REST APIs (Services)

2) Service Registry

3) API Gateway

-> Services are nothing but rest apis that we develop for our application. Every Rest api or service is called as one microservice. Every Microservice will be developed as a seperate project.

-> Service Registry is used to maintain list of services and services details in one place.

-> API Gateway acts as front door for all our services. Filters and Routing we will do in API Gateway.
