Yesterday's session : Service Registry & Services

-----------------------------------------------------------

-> Service Registry is used to register all the services which are available in our application.

-> Spring Cloud Netflix library provided 'Eureka Server' which we can use as 'Service Registry'.

-> One Service is nothing but one Rest API

------------------------------------------------------------------
-> If Eureka Server running on 8761 port number then clients will be auto registered.


-> If we don't want to register Service Registry project with Eureka Server then we should add below property in service-registery application yml file.

eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false

-> If Eureka Server Running with different number (not 8761) or in different machine client application should be registered manually with eurkea. For client registration we will write below property

eureka:
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: <Eureka-Sever-URL>
