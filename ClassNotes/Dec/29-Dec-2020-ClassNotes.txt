Last session : Yml, Jetty, External Server Deployment

-> I have shared video for Config Server
-------------------------------------------------------------

-> ConfigServer is used to externalize config-props of our applications.

-> If we externalize config-props then our application will be loosely coupled with config-props.

-> In our application we will create bootstrap.yml to configure config-server url.

bootstrap.yml vs application.yml
--------------------------------
-> In spring boot, bootstrap.yml file will be loaded first

-> In bootstrap.yml file we will configure application name and config server url
-------------------------------------------------------------

Securing REST API
---------------------------------------------------------
-> When we develop a REST api anybody can access that api by sending HTTP request.

-> If we want to process the requests of our paid clients then we should secure our rest apis.

-> Rest APIs can be secured in below ways

	a) Http Basic Auth
	b) OAuth
	c) JWT
	d) SSL 

HTTP Basic Authentication
-------------------------
In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: Basic <credentials>, where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon :

-----------------------------------------------------------
-> When we implement HTTP Basic authentication for our REST api, we will provide uname and pwd to our clients.

	Ex : uname=ashok  pwd=ashokit123

-> If client wants to access our rest api, client should send uname and pwd in Http Header like below

	Authorization: Basic Base64.encode(uname:pwd)

	* Authorization is header key

	* Basic Base64.encode(uname:pwd) is header value

-> When client make a request with Authorization key and value, API side SecurityConfig will verify credentials are correct or not. If credentials are correct request will be processed else request processing will not happen
