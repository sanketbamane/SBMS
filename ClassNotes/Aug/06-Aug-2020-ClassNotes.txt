Yesterday's session : What is Spring Boot ?

Today's session : First Spring Boot Application
----------------------------------------------------------

-> Spring Boot is an approach to develop Spring Based applications with minimal or less configurations

-> All Spring Modules we can use in Spring Boot also

-> Whatever the application that we can develop using Spring, same application can be developed by using Spring Boot also.

-> Spring Boot is not replacement for Spring. 

-> Spring Boot is an enhancement for Spring Framework

What are the advantages of Spring Boot
--------------------------------------
1) Auto Configuration

2) Embedded Servers (Tomact, Jetty & Undertow)

3) Starter Poms (Simplifies maven configuration)

4) Actuators (Production Ready Features)

5) Easy Integration with Third Party Libraries

6) No XML configuration

7) Integration with Embedded DB (H2)

Dis-Advantages of Spring Boot
-----------------------------
-> Spring Boot is best suitable for scratch development projects.

-> IT is very difficult and time consuming process to convert existing spring framework based projects into spring boot applications.

Conclusion
-----------

Spring Boot = 
	(Spring Framework + Auto Configuration + Stater Poms + Embedded 			Servers + Actuators ) - XML Configuration

Creating First Project Using Spring Boot
-----------------------------------------
Spring Boot Application we will create in below 2 ways

1) Using Spring Initializer website (start.spring.io)

2) Using IDEs
