Yesterday's session : IOC & DI

Today's session : Component Scanning
------------------------------------------------------------------

-> IOC is a principle which is used to manage and colloborate dependencies among the objects in the application

-> The process of injecting one class object into another class object is called as Dependency Injection.

What is Component Scanning?
---------------------------
-> It is the process of searching for spring beans available in the application.

-> Component Scanning is built-in functionality available in Spring Boot we no need to enable explicitly.

-> In SpringBoot, component scanning will start from base package.

What is Base Package in SpringBoot?
-----------------------------------
-> The package which contains boot start class is called as Base Package.

-> IOC will search for bean classes in Base package, if available then it will instantiate those classes

-> Once base package scanning is completed, then it will search for bean classes in sub packages of bases package.

What is sub-package of base package?
------------------------------------
-> Any package name which is starting with base package name then it is called as sub-package for the base package.

-> IOC will load bean classes from sub-packages and will instantiate them.

Example
--------

Base Package : com.ashokit

com.ashokit.controller (sub-package)

com.ashokit.service (sub-package)

com.ashokit.dao (sub-package)

com.util (not sub-package) - It will not participate in component scanning
