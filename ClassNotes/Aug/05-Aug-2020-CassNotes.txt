Today's session : Spring vs Spring Boot
-------------------------------------------------------

What is Spring Framework?
-------------------------
-> Spring is an application development framework

-> By using Spring We can develop below Types of Applications

	1) Standalone applications

	2) Web applications

	3) Distributed applications

-> Spring framework developed in Modular fashion.    Several modules are available in Spring framework.

-> Spring Framework provides Loosely Coupling

-> Spring provided IOC & DI to achieve Loosely coupling in application development.

	* IOC : Inversion of control
	* DI : Dependency Injection

IOC : It is a principle which is used manage and colloborate dependencies among the objects in our application.

DI : The process of Injecting dependent bean into target bean.

-> Spring is a versatile framework

What is Spring Boot?
--------------------
-> Spring Boot is an approach to develop Spring Based applications with minimal or less configurations.

-> Spring Boot is not replacement for Spring Framework

-> Spring Boot is part of Spring Framework only, but it reduces configurations required in application development.

-> All Spring Framwork modules we can use with Spring Boot also

-> What type of applications we can develop using spring framework, same type of applications can be developed using Spring Boot with minimal configurations.


Features of Spring Boot
------------------------
1) Minimal or Less Spring Based Configuration

2) Starter POMs (to simply build configuration)

3) Embedded Servers to run Web Apps

Note : We can deploy Spring Boot application to Extneral Servers also.

4) Production Ready Features (health check, metrics, Heap dump, thread dump and configProps) provided with Actuators

5) Auto Configuration (It will guess configuration required to run our application and will do that configuration as per our app requirement)

6) No Xml configurations required
