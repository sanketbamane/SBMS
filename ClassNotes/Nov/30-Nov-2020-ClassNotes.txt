--------------------------------------------------------------
-> A project nothing but collection modules

-> Software Projects are used to reduce human efforts

-> A software Project can be developed in 2 ways

		a)Monolith Architecture
		b)Microservices Architecture

What is Monolith Architecture?
------------------------------
-> If we develop all the modules & Components in single project then it is called as Monolith Architecture Based Project.

-> For monolith architecture based project we will create one war file which contains all functionalities of project.

-> Monolith Architecture Based Project war is called as Fat war

-> We will deploy fat war file to single server

-> All incoming requests which are coming to application should be processed by Single server

-> As single server is handling all incoming requests burden will be increased on the server

-> When burden got increased on server, then problems will occur

		a) Request Processing May take more

		b) Request Process may fail

		c) Server Can crash

-> To overcome the above problems, we will use Load Balancer concept in Industry.

-> Load Balancing is the process of distributing the load
