Yesterday's session : Distributed applications
----------------------------------------------

-> If one application is communicating with another application then they are called as Distributed Applications.

What is Intereoperability?
--------------------------
Irrespective of platform and irrespective of language if one application is communicating with another application then they are called as 'Intereoperable Applications'.


	   Java --------------> .Net
		
	   .Net ---------------> Python

	   Python -------------> Java

Distributed Technologies
------------------------
a) CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) (outdated)

b) RMI (Remote Method Invocation) (Outdated)

c) EJB (Enterprise Java Beans) (outdated)

d) Webservices (In use)

e) Restful Services (Trending in market)


Note : From the above list only Webservices & RESTful Services will provide Intereoperability.


-> To overcome the problems of CORBA, RMI and EJB technologies WebServices Came into Market.

-> Using Webservices we can develop distributed applications with Intereoperability.

-> Webservices started by WS-I (Webservices Intereoperability) Team. It is a non profitable organization. WS-I team contains employees from different companies.

-> With the help of all the people WS-I identified some rules & guidelines to achieve Intereoperability.

-> The Rules & Gudilines Provided by WS-I is called as B.P 1.0 Specification

B.P 1.0 Specification
---------------------
-> When B.P 1.0 came into market all programming languages started adopting rules & guidelines of B.P 1.0 specification.

-> Sun Microsystem also adopted B.P 1.0 Specification Rules & Gudilines and provided JAX-RPC api.

-> JAX-RPC api is the first and foremost api released by Sun Microsystem to develop
    Webservices with Intereoperability.

-> JAX-RPC stands for Java Api For XML - Remote Procedural Call

-> For JAX-RPC api we have several implementations. They are 

		a) Sun Implementation (SI)
		b) Apache Axis
		c) Oracle Weblogic
		d) IBM Websphere etc..


-> As B.P 1.0 specification became success in market, WS-I team released B.P 1.1 specification into market.

B.P 1.1 Specification
---------------------
-> When B.P 1.1 specification came into market, all programming languages started adopting rules & guidelines of B.P 1.1 specification.

-> Sun Micro System also adopted rules & Guidelines of B.P 1.1 specification and relased JAX-WS Api.

-> JAX-WS is the second api that got released from Sun Microsystem to develop Webservices with Intereoperability.

-> JAX-WS stands for Java API For XML - Webservices

-> For JAX-WS API we have several implementations, They are 

	a) Reference Implementation (RI)
	b) Apache AXIS 2
	c) Apache CXF
	d) Metro
	e) Oracle Weblogic
	f) IBM Websphere
	g) JBOSS etc...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> In Java we can develop Webservice in 2 ways.

	1) JAX-RPC API
	2) JAX-WS API


-> If we develop a webservice using JAX-RPC API or JAX-WS API then that web service is called as 'SOAP Based WebService'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> When SOAP based webservices came into market people felt very happy and started using SOAP Webservices in applications to achieve Intereoperability.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> The author of HTTP Protocol 'Roy Fielding' identified some loop holes in SOAP Webservices and he started his analysis to find Alternate for SOAP Webservices.

-> He got motivated by seeing Internet Services and started analyzing how internet services are working.

-> He identified principle which made internet success and he documented those principle and released into market as 'Rest Architecture Principles'.

-> When Roy Fielding Provided REST Architecture Principles people are not intrested in initial days. Later they realized and starting using REST Principles that became super hit in the market.

-> Programming languages are started adopting Roy Fielding Rest principles.

-> Sun Micro System also adopted REST Architecture Principles and Released 
   JAX-RS api.

-> JAX-RS stands for 'Java api for xml - RESTful Services'
