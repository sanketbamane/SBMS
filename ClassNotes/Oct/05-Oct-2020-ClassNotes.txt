Last session : URL Mappings in Controllers
------------------------------------------

-> We can create Multiple controllers in Spring MVC application

-> In One Controller class we can have multiple methods

-> For every controller we can map class level url pattern

-> For Controller methods also we can map method level url pattern

-> We need to make all methods url patterns are unique

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> When we run spring boot web application by default it will be deployed in Embedded Container

-> Embedded Conatiner is used to deploy and run our web application

-> Apache Tomcat is the default embedded container for Spring Boot Web application

-> For Every Boot Web Application, Embedded Container will start. Once our application is stopped, Embedded Container also will be stopped.

Q) Can i run two web apps in One Embedded Container?
-----------------------------------------------------
Ans) Not possible, for every project its own embedded container will be available.


Q) Can i run more than one app in External Server?
--------------------------------------------------
Ans) We can deploy more than one application also in External Server. They will be differentiated with Project Name (Context-Path)



-> As Spring Boot applications are running in Embedded Container we should not specify Project name in the URL (default behaviour)

-> If we want to include project name in the URL to acces controller methods then we can add Context-Path for the project in application.properties file.


Note: By default Embedded Containers will run on 8080 Port Number. To change that port number we can add below property in application.properties file.

	server.port = 9090

Note: If oracle server is not insttalled no need to change the port number because oracle server will run on 8080. Two application can't use same port number in one machine.


Adding Context Path For Boot Application
----------------------------------------
-> Add below property in application.properties file

	server.servlet.context-path=/App

Note: Default context-path for boot application is empty.
