Yesterday's session : First Web App Development using Spring Boot
------------------------------------------------------------------

-> In Spring MVC, Dispatcher Servlet acts as Front Controller

-> HandlerMapper will identify request handler

-> Controller will process the request and will return logical view name.    It is called as Request Handler

-> View Resolver identifies view file using preffix and suffix

-> View component will render model data on the view file

-> Finally Dispatcher Servlet will send response to client request
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> spring-boot-starter-web dependency is used to build web app

-> @Controller annotation is used to represent our class as Spring Controller

-> @RequestMapping annotation to bind controller method to URL pattern

-> Controller method returning ModelAndView object

-> For ModelViewObject we are setting below details

		1)data in the form of key & value
		2)logical view name

Note: Model data we can access in view file using key

--------------------------------------------------------


@Controller
public class SecondController {

	@RequestMapping(value="/welcome", method=RequestMethod.GET)
	public ModelAndView displayWelcomeMsg() {
		ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView();
		mav.addObject("msg", "Welcome to Ashok IT...!!");
		mav.setViewName("index");
		return mav;
	}

	@GetMapping("/greet")
	public String displayGreetMsg(Model model) {
		model.addAttribute("msg", "Good Morning..!!");
		return "index";
	}
}

--------------------------------------------------------
-> @GetMapping annotation is used to bind our method to HTTP GET Request

-> Model is an interface which is used to store data in the form of key and value pair

-> Model is used to send data from controller to UI
