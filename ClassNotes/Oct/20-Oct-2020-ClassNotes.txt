Yesterday's session : RESTFul Services & Microservices Course Content
Today's sesion : Distributed Applications
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-> By using java we can develop below types of applications

	1)Stand-alone applications
	
	2)Web applications

	3)Distributed applications

What is Stand-alone application?
--------------------------------
-> The applications which are specific to only one machine are called as Standlaone applications

Ex : Eclipse, SQL Developer, Notepad, Calculator etc..

What is Web Application?
------------------------
-> The application which we can access from browser are called as web applications

Ex : facebook, gmail, irctc etc....

-> Web applications are used for 'C 2 B' communication (Customer to Business)


What is Distributed Application?
--------------------------------
-> If one application is communicating with another application then they are called as Distributed Applications

-> Distributed Applications are used for B 2 B communication (Business to Business)

Ex :

	Passport -------- AADHAR

	MakeMyTrip ---------Air Lines

-> Distributed applications will be developed to re-use business services


-> Now a days we are developing distributed applications with intereoperability

What is Intereoperability?
--------------------------
Irrespective of the platform and irrespective of programmaing languages if one application is communicating with another application then they are called as Intereperable applications.


	java --------> .Net 

	.Net --------> Python

	Python --------> Java


-> To develop Distributed application with Intereoperability we will use below concepts

		1)Webservices

		2)RESTful Services
