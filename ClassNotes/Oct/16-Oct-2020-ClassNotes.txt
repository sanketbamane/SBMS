Yesterday's session : H2 Database (in memory)
---------------------------------------------
-> Our spring boot having very good integration with H2 database

-> H2 db is also called as Embedded DB or In-Memory DB

-> No need to do any installation to work with H2 Database

-> If we add dependency in pom.xml file then DB will be available for our application.

-> If application stopped, then DB also will be stopped

-> Embedded DBs will be used for temporary purpose.
