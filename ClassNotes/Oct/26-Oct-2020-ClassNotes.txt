-> Sun Microsystem released below 2 apis to develop webservices

	1) JAX-RPC API (B.P 1.0 Specification)

	2) JAX-WS API (B.P 1.1 Specification)

-> By using above 2 apis if we develop a webservices then it is called as SOAP Based Webservice.

Note: But now a days we are not using the above APIs directley because Spring Framwork has provided support for developing SOAP Webservices & RESTful services.
